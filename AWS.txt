load balancer(ELB)- traffic forwarding n div into multiple ecs instances
single dns access to app- no failiure- health checks - availability among zones
Types- (static hostname)
classic v1 SSL-deprecated
Application ALB v2 - Layer 7 - HTTP apps - mul apps same machine - micro serv /container apss - routes to target groups(url/hostname) then to healthy instances
	-Stickiness (cookies ALB level) - X-Forwarded-For (Private Ip hidden)
Network  v2 Layer 4- TCP - High Performace 

can be exposed internally/ext


Auto Scaling groups- ADD Intsances/ remove- scale in/ out to handle load- define range - can be done via LBs

RDS- Relational DB Service -SQL query- Os aptching - backups- Monitoring- performance - more AZs - no SSH
Read Scalabilty - read Replicas - ASYNC - latency - connect strings
Standby- replica in diff AZ - increase avail in failover 
Backups- Daily - Trans log- Rollback enhanced - Retention - long term backups
Security - encryption / Enforce SSl -SGs - IAM policy - Login info
Aurora- High performance - SQL ?POstgres compatible - Inc Storage _ failover - scalable - cloud friendly

ElastiCache- RDS for Caches- In mem - high performance - Load reduction on databases 
- Query to elaticache - Cache hit/ Cache miss - RDS
_ Invalidation startegy for upd data
- Session handling  - no re-authentication
